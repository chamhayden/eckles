      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>

          <li>Make contact immediately with cs6080@cse.unsw.edu.au and advise them that you are unwell</li>
          <li>Immediately submit a Special Consideration application saying that you felt ill during the exam and were unable to continue</li>
          <li>If you were able to advise cs6080@cse.unsw.edu.au of the illness during the assessment, attach screenshots of this conversation to the Special Consideration application</li>
        </ol>
      </Typography>

        Date, Time, and Duration
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        The final exam will be a 3 hour exam that begins at 1pm Fri 24th Nov and ends at 4pm Fri 24th Nov.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Students outside of Asia-Pacific region, or students with ELS requirements, may have their exam time altered and communicated to the lecturer in charge privately. If you have been given alternate instructions about start and finish times, they apply.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Only submissions made during your exam time window will be counted as valid.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Exam Structure
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Your exam will be worth a certain number of arbitrary marks, but these marks will make up 20% of the course (the size of this assessment).
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        The exam will be very similar to assignment 4, with the following simplified criteria:
        <ul>
          <li>80%: Providing the features and functionality required</li>
          <li>20%: Ensuring mobile responsiveness on desktop, tablet, mobile</li>
        </ul>
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        The main differences compared to assignment 4 are that the exam will:
        <ul>
          <li>Be substantially less work than ass4</li>
          <li>Not be assessed in terms of linting & code design & accessibility & ui/ux - we will not look at your source code</li>
          <li>Will not have a backend attached (local storage will be used instead)</li>
        </ul>
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        You are allowed to your code code from other assessments in the exam (or in the case of assignment 4, your group's code).
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Platform to complete exam
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        The exam will be distributed via gitlab, and operationally be very similar to the release and submission of a single lab repo.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        The exam must be completed locally or via vlab. Regardless of where you complete the exam, you must:
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure you push the work you want submitted to your gitlab master branch</li>
          <li>Ensure that your code works as expected in the latest version of Google Chrome</li>
        </ul>
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Technical issues relating to your local environment are not grounds for special consideration.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Do not leave it to the deadline to push your code to master. Submit each question when you finish working on it.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5" component="div" gutterBottom>

      </Typography>

        When posting a message to the forum, it's important that you are detailed in your description of your issues. If you are having technical issues:
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure your most recent code is up on gitlab</li>
          <li>Show screenshots of the issue (code, terminal, etc)</li>
          <li>Explain how you produced it</li>
          <li>Whether you're running it locally or in vlab</li>
        </ul>
      </Typography>

        Failure to comply may result in delays in responding to your queries.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Clarifications made during the exam will be made at the top of this page. After each clarification, an email will be sent to all students in the course notifying them that a clarification has been made.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5" component="div" gutterBottom>
        Submission
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" component="div" gutterBottom>
        There will be no submit command for the final exam. At the end of the exam time, whatever code is on your latest commit pushed to your master branch (on gitlab) will be what is submitted and marked.
